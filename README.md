# lotless
Lotless is a full-stack platform for managing curbside valet operations using on-street parking and agile vehicle retrieval. Built with Flask and React, it allows attendants to check in vehicles, track parking locations, process payments, and manage jobs efficiently. Designed with mobility in mind, the system supports the use of electric scooters for rapid movement between drop-off and pick-up points, making it ideal for parks, events, and flexible urban settings.
